# [Advent JS 2024](https://adventjs.dev/) • (Solutions)

Welcome to my repository where I'm storing my solutions for the **Advent JS** 2024 edition, this project was created by [@midudev](https://github.com/midudev).

One of the best things you can do is to try to solve the problems on your own!, take baby steps and don't aim for perfection.
If you want to discuss some of the problems/solutions to the challenges, feel free to contact me via Discord.

I will be happy to connect with you! :) ✨
